STAR CITIZEN v3.12 Thrustmaster T16000M-HOTAS drivers

By John Silvia
Freely distributed

Features in this version:
* Stick "twist" (pitch) is mapped onto the throttle bats instead of stick twist.
* Full X-Y-Z thrust translation, boost and cruise controls on throttle sticks
* Mining mode/Radar Mode, Quantum on middle stick
* Includes emote keyboard mappings - (best to read the XML, it's not hard)
* Push-To-Talk mapped to mouse button-4 and to throttle red-button

For many players this can be a good baseline - start here and make your own setup.

Cheers.
